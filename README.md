# Laptop_Price_predictor_mifta
I have developed this portfolio project in streamlit

Description: Developed a machine learning model to predict laptop prices based on their specifications, including brand, processor type,RAM, storage capacity,
             graphics card, and display size. Used various ML algorithms, including linear regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression, 
             support vector regression, and gradient boosting regression, to predict prices. Preprocessed the data by cleaning and encoding categorical variables.
             Evaluated model performance using mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and root mean squared error (RMSE).

Skills Demonstrated:

Machine learning algorithms: linear regression, decision tree regression, random forest regression, support vector regression, gradient boosting regression
Data preprocessing: cleaning and encoding categorical variables
Evaluation metrics: MAE, MSE, RMSE
